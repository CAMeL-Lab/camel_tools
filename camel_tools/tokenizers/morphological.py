            disambiguator to use for tokenization.
        scheme (:obj:`str`): The tokenization scheme to use.
            You can use the
            :meth:`~camel_tools.disambig.common.Disambiguator.tok_feats`
            method of your chosen disambiguator to get a list of tokenization
            schemes it produces.
        split (:obj:`bool`, optional): If set to True, then morphological
            tokens will be split into separate strings, otherwise they will be
            delimited by an underscore. Defaults to False.
        diac (:obj:`bool`, optional): If set to True, then output tokens will
            be diacritized, otherwise they will be undiacritized.
            Defaults to False.
            Note that when the tokenization scheme is set to 'bwtok', the
            number of produced undiacritized tokens might be less than the
            diacritized tokens becuase the 'bwtok' scheme can have
            morphemes that are standalone diacritics (e.g. case and mood).
