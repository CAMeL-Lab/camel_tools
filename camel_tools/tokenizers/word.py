    punctuation/symbol/emoji characters, or multi-character emoji sequences.
    This function is language agnostic and splits all characters marked as
    punctuation or symbols in the Unicode specification.
    For example, tokenizing :code:`'Hello,    world!!!'`
    would yield :code:`['Hello', ',', 'world', '!', '!', '!']`.
    If split_digits is set to True, it also splits on number.
    For example, tokenizing :code:`'Hello,    world123!!!'`
    would yield :code:`['Hello', ',', 'world', '123', '!', '!', '!']`.

        sentence (:obj:`str`): Sentence to tokenize.
        split_digits (:obj:`bool`, optional): The flag to split on number.
